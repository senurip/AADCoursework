## 🔐 JWT Authentication

CEE uses **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure and stateless authentication. After logging in, users receive a token which must be included in headers for accessing protected endpoints. This ensures secure, scalable user sessions.

---

## 💳 PayHere Payment Integration

CEE is integrated with the **PayHere** payment gateway to allow secure online payments for travel bookings. Users can easily complete transactions using cards, mobile wallets, or bank accounts — with confirmation and booking status updated in real-time.

> For testing, sandbox credentials are configured. Replace them with your production keys when deploying live.
